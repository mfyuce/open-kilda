# OpenFlow cookies data

Cookie filed is 64 bits long, it is divided into several bit groups. Some bit fields are system wide i.e. have same meaning for possible cookies, other bit fields are specific for specific cookie type (some subset of cookies).

## System wide cookie fields
This is set of basic fields that presents in all cookie types.
